# Scones Unlimited Image Classification Project

## Project Overview

Scones Unlimited, a scone-delivery-focused logistics company, aims to optimize delivery operations using an image classification model. This model identifies delivery vehicles (bicycles and motorcycles) to route drivers efficiently, enhancing operational efficiency.

## Technologies Used

- **AWS Sagemaker**: Building and deploying the image classification model
- **AWS Lambda**: Creating supporting services
- **AWS Step Functions**: Composing an event-driven application
- **Python**: Scripting and model development
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Data exploration and model training

## Project Steps

### 1. Data Staging
Prepare and upload the training and testing datasets to an S3 bucket. The datasets contain images of bicycles and motorcycles.

### 2. Model Training and Deployment
Use AWS Sagemaker to explore the data, train the image classification model, and deploy the trained model.

### 3. Lambdas and Step Function Workflow
Create AWS Lambda functions to preprocess input data and perform model inference. Define the Step Functions workflow to integrate these services.

### 4. Testing and Evaluation
Test the deployed model and evaluate its performance using a set of validation images.

### 5. Optional Challenge
Implement additional features or improvements to the model or workflow as per the optional challenge guidelines.

### 6. Cleanup Cloud Resources
Ensure all AWS resources created during the project are properly cleaned up to avoid unnecessary charges.
